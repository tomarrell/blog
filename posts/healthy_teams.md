# How to build a healthy dev team

In my team at SumUp over the last 2 1/2 years, we've hired a total of 7
engineers, none of which have left the company. One has moved internally,
however due to chasing new personal challenges. This is a fair amount better
than some teams I've been part of in the past, and one of the primary reasons
for this I believe is our technical decision making process.

If you've been working in software for a reasonable length of time, you've
probably been part of both high functioning teams, but also potentially teams
which struggled with churn. These are not necessarily mutually exclusive,
however, certainly inversely correlated.

Now churn of engineers is not uncommon, but high churn has significant costs
to any business and team morale. Hence, keeping it minimal is certainly
preferable. 

It's part of human nature to want to feel like we are making a contribution in
some way. This is especially true of engineers when it comes to technical
discussions. Someone who not not feel their opinion is valued will very quickly
disengage and likely take up an opportunity where their opinion is valued.

This is one of the key aspects to a healthy team. Making sure everyone feels
like they contribute in a meaningful way within the team. The same goes for
engineers of all levels when it comes to technical discussions. Yet it is often
those that have less experience who are more susceptible to not having their
opinions valued.

This is a commonly overlooked reason for churn amongst juniors. Faster career
progression is certainly the dominant factor, but increasingly as companies work
to resolve internal progression, intra-team contribution should be in the
spotlight.


## The feeling of contribution

It is common for teams to have a heirarchy. Engineers who are more or less
experienced, with the more experienced ones tending to have more of a say in
technical discussions. As a technical leader, this is an important and often
overlooked responsibility which without careful attention can have significant
repercussions on the team as a whole.

Most companies have more or less a mapping to junior, intermediate and senior
engineer job titles, with advancement beyond this in either a technical or
managerial fashion. It is also common for healthy teams to be made up of members
from each of these competencies.

The issue comes when the contribution to decision making is weighted
unevenly.

The best way to encourage participation and this all-important sense of
contribution is democratically. A simple vote. All members with an equal say. A
senior and a junior with the same vote. Now before you jump in the comments and
tell me that a junior shouldn't be have the same decisions making power when
making critical decisions which may affect the long term functionality of a
system, hold on a second.

Yes, a senior is a senior as they've been screwed up a fair few more times than
someone who's just starting out. You get a pretty good sense of what will and
won't work. However that doesn't give them more of a say, instead, it hands them
the responsibility to transfer this experience, heck someonetimes just
intuition, to more junior members.

Essentially, the senior members need to learn to communicate their own decision
making process which led to their justification. And not just the senior, this
goes for everyone, weighted proportional to how strong one's opinion is.

Democratic decision making is a key to success for long-term, sustainable teams
making difficult technical decisions on a regular basis. Everything else will
have downsides which are not worth it.


## The importance of technical communication

This does leave us with one skill that is necessary amongst the senior engineers
at your company. Strong communication skills. Or more specifically, strong
communication when it comes to conveying and making arguments for their
justifications.

Arguing is a skill, it should be learned. How to convey you came to a conclusion
in a clear manner is incredibly hard, but incredibly necessary when working with
other people. It's normal to struggle initially, as I did, however with
persistence you can learn it just like anything else.


## Notes: 

- It will lead to faster progression
- It will make people feel like their voice is heard
- It will encourage your seniors to improve their communication skills

and ultimately, lead to a healthier development team.
