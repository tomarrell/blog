# Decision making for healthy dev teams

> TLDR: putting the responsibility of communicating justification on senior
> members of a team and making technical decisions by an equal representation
> vote, is the least bad way for a sustainable, healthy technical team.

Over the last 2 1/2 years we have hired a total of 7 engineers for my team at
SumUp, none of whom have yet left the company. One has moved internally however,
to chase new personal challenges. This is a fair amount better than some teams
I've been part of in the past, and one of the primary reasons for this I believe
is our technical decision making process.

If you've been working in software for a reasonable length of time, you've
probably been part of both highly functioning teams, but also potentially teams
which struggled with churn. These are not necessarily mutually exclusive,
however, certainly inversely correlated.

Now churn of engineers is not uncommon, but high churn has significant costs
to any business and team morale. Hence, keeping it minimal is certainly
preferable.

It's part of human nature to want to feel like we are making a contribution in
some way. This is especially true of engineers when it comes to technical
discussions. Someone who not not feel their opinion is valued will very quickly
disengage and likely take up an opportunity where their opinion is valued.

This is one of the key aspects to a healthy team. Making sure everyone feels
like they contribute in a meaningful way within the team. The same goes for
engineers of all levels when it comes to technical discussions. Yet it is often
those that have less experience who are more susceptible to not having their
opinions heard or valued.

This is a commonly overlooked reason for churn amongst juniors. Faster career
progression is certainly the dominant factor, but increasingly as companies work
to resolve internal progression, intra-team contribution should be in the
spotlight.


## The feeling of contribution

It is common for teams to have a heirarchy. Engineers who are more or less
experienced, with the more experienced ones tending to have more of a say in
technical discussions. As a technical leader, this is an important and often
overlooked responsibility which without careful attention can have significant
repercussions on the team as a whole.

Most companies have more or less a mapping to junior, intermediate and senior
engineer job titles, with advancement beyond this in either a technical or
managerial fashion. It is also common for healthy teams to be made up of members
from each of these competencies.

The issue comes when the contribution to decision making is weighted unevenly.

The best way to encourage participation and this all-important sense of
contribution is democratically. A simple vote. All members with an equal say. A
senior and a junior with the same vote. Now, before you jump in the comments and
tell me that a junior shouldn't be have the same decision making power when
making critical decisions which may affect the long term functionality of a
system, hold on a second.

Yes, a senior is a senior as they've likely screwed up a fair few more times
than someone who is just starting out. You get a pretty good sense of what will
and won't work after spending hours debugging. However, this shouldn't give what
they say more weight, instead, *it hands them the responsibility to transfer
this experience*, even if it is sometimes just intuition, to more junior
members.

Essentially, the senior members need to learn to communicate the own decision
making process which led to their justification. And not just the senior, this
goes for everyone, weighted proportionally to how strong one's opinion is.

Democratic decision making is a key to success for long-term, sustainable teams
making difficult technical decisions on a regular basis. Everything else will
have downsides which are detrimental.

Anecdotally, our team has been following the above process for nearly all
technical decisions for a couple of years now. A proposal is written, a
discussion is scheduled, sometimes for the same day it is finished, which
concludes with a vote. The decision will then be documented and the proposal
archived.

Personally, I partially attribute the high happiness, productivity and lack of
attrition to our democratic decision making process. Witnessing other teams who
do not have this struggle on one or more metrics. Not necessarily causation, but
certainly correlation.


## The importance of technical communication

This does leave us with one skill that is necessary amongst the senior engineers
at your company. Strong communication skills. Or more specifically, strong
communication when it comes to conveying and justifying a conclusion.

Arguing is a skill, it needs to be learned. The ability to convey how you came
to a conclusion in a clear manner is incredibly hard, but incredibly necessary
when working with other people. It's normal to struggle initially, as I did,
however with persistence you can learn it just like anything else.

A side-effect of improving communication from more experienced engineers is the
faster progression of those with less experience. Take for example a junior who
is part of a team where the experienced developers explain why they should
choose a particular database. Quite obviously, that junior is going to come away
with a lot more context than one where that wasn't the case.

This helps the junior progress faster in their career while feeling like they
are meaningfully contributing to the success of the team.


## Wrapping up

If you're a senior member your team, ask yourself if you're communicating the
justification for your decisions as well as you could be. Also don't be afraid
to let some less important decisions slide in a vote. Experience should tell you
what is important, and what can take the back seat to prevent people feeling like
there's a silent dictator. 

'till next time.
